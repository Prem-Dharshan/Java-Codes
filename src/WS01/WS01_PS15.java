// 15. Write a program that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how much
// money could be saved by carpooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon
// emissions and reducing traffic congestion. The application should input the following
// information and display the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work:
// a) Total miles driven per day.
// b) Cost per gallon of gasoline.
// c) Average miles per gallon.
// d) Parking fees per day.
// e) Tolls per day.
