// 12. Acme Parts runs a small factory and employs workers who are paid one of three hourly rates
// depending on their shift: first shift, $17 per hour; second shift, $18.50 per hour; third shift, $22
// per hour. Each factory worker might work any number of hours per week; any hours greater
// than 40 are paid at one and one-half times the usual rate. In addition, second- and third-shift
// workers can elect to participate in the retirement plan for which 3% of the workerâ€™s gross pay
// is deducted from the paychecks. Write a program that prompts the user for hours worked and
// shift, and, if the shift is 2 or 3, whether the worker elects the retirement. Display: (1) the hours
// worked, (2) the shift, (3) the hourly pay rate, (4) the regular pay, (5) overtime pay, (6) the total
// of regular and overtime pay, and (7) the retirement deduction, if any, and (8) the net pay.
